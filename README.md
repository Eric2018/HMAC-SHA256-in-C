# HMAC-SHA256-in-C
An implementation of HMAC-SHA256 in C language.

This project was in response of a stackoverflow question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49776226/hmacsha256-in-webassembly-compiled-with-emscripten/49862020#49862020

This is for educational purposes only, and I can not guarantee it will work flawlessly, because I feel I haven't extensively tested or implemented it but there you go.
